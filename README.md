# Command Writer

This is a simple node application that reads a json file "commandlist.json", and converts all objects within to files.
The objects within commandlist.json must contain properties "filename" and "content" as strings.

## Commandlist

The commandlist contains a list of files that can be used as simple run commands. Simply add the folder to windows path variable.
